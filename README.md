# Code 401: Advanced Software Development in Java with SpringMVC and Android

## Overview
Learn the language used at Google, Amazon, Netflix and other big companies.
Gain an understanding of statically typed languages and gain a leg up on
learning other languages in the future.

Learn to write clean, crystal-clear, well-tested, advanced Java code using
industry standard software engineering patterns while building servers with
SpringMVC and building mobile apps with Android.

Students will use IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio to create Java applications.
Students will use Heroku to deploy the applications onto live servers. Students
will install Android applications onto their own phones and have the apps
communicate with Firebase, Google's realtime database.

The course focuses on fundamental computer science concepts like
object-oriented programming, advanced data structures and algorithms, Big O
asymptotic analysis, and the structure of statically typed languages.

## Assignments, Deadlines, Late Work, and other fun things
There are several types of assignments that are required for this course, and they have different policies on late work.

#### Complete/incomplete
* Readings: All readings are visible at the beginning of the course. Each reading is due by the start of the lecture that covers that reading, and locks (no late submissions) at midnight on that day.
* Daily Journals: Each daily journal will become available 2 hours before lecture, is due by the start of lecture, and locks at midnight on that day.
* Prework: You should have already finished this; if not, you should reach out to your instructor, and finish any remaining items ASAP.

#### Graded out of points
All assignments graded out of a number of points lose 20% automatically for late submissions. (Resubmits after an on-time submission do not incur this penalty.)

* Career Coaching: Career coaching assignments are used during career coaching workshops; ensure you have completed the assignments by the start of the workshop. All career coaching assignments due before each workshop will lock on the day of the workshop.
* Code Challenges: Each code challenge is released at 5pm, to be worked on that night. The code challenge is due the next day by the start of lecture, and is graded as complete/incomplete. You may resubmit code challenges for up to 10 days after the assignment is due; code challenges lock after 10 days.
* Labs: Each lab is released at 5pm, and should be worked on the next day during lab time. The lab is due by the start of the following lecture. You may resubmit labs for up to 10 days after the assignment is due; labs lock after 10 days.

## Career Coaching Curriculum
Three full days of Code 401 are dedicated to workshops and presentations that
teach students the skills they'll need for their job search, such as personal
branding techniques, effective networking practices, how to create an
attractive resume, mastering personal and technical interviews, job search best
practices, and more.

Additionally, during each Project Week, students present projects that will go
into their professional portfolio. [Learn More »](https://www.codefellows.org/get-a-software-development-job)

## Learn with Stacked Modules
Concepts in each of our courses are taught using stacked modules, where a new
concept is introduced in each class session, building upon what came before it.
This is a challenging style that requires persistence, practice, and
collaboration, but allows more concepts to be introduced over the length of the
course. This method helps students learn and retain more information in a short
period of time. [Learn more about stacked modules »](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/how-to-accelerate-your-learning-with-stacked-modules)

## Material Requirements
Students are required to bring their own laptop with plenty of free space on
the hard drive. All students will be responsible for ensuring their computers contain
the necessary tools to build and run the programs they write. These tools are available
for any of MacOS/Windows/Linux, so students should use the operating system they are
most comfortable with. By the first day of class, students will need:

* Java command line tools installed on their computer
* [IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition)](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
* The latest version of Google Chrome
* A GitHub account

## Professionalism
Punctuality, participation in discussions, completion of assignments, and
demonstration of professional courtesy to others are required, in accordance
with our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/codefellows/code-of-conduct).
Attendance will be taken at the beginning of every class. Passing requires at
least 90% attendance. Students should always contact the instructors ahead of
time if they are unable to attend all or part of published class / lab hours.
