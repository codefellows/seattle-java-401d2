# Final Project Requirements

Your final project must use Java to build an interesting, well-thought-out, complete Android application.

Specifically, you must:

1. Build an Android application.
    - Target a reasonable version of Android.
    - Have a complete, working feature set, both at MVP and with stretch goals.
    - Implement standard Android features; your app must pass the Google Play Developer Program Policies. This includes:
        - minimum functionality
        - security
        - accessibility
        - privacy & permissions concerns
        - no DB or network calls on the UI thread
2. Test your Android application.
    - Unit test utility pieces of code, using JUnit or similar.
    - UI integration test all screens and features within your app, using Espresso or similar.
    - If you write a server for your app, that must also be tested.
    - If you use Firebase, you must test your integration with Firebase, including testing any security rules on data access.
3. Document your work and your application.
    - Include a README.md file with:
        - an overview of the application and its functionality
        - screenshots of the application
        - directions to install the application using your deployed apk, or link to the Play Store
        - a list of technologies used in the application
        - directions to clone the repo and get the application running on your own phone
    - Include relevant comments in your code.
        - Do NOT include irrelevant comments or dead code in your application.
4. Distribute your application to users.
    - Ideal: Deploy to the Google Play Store.
    - Less ideal: Link to your apk file, hosted online.
