# Lecture 31: Testing, Espresso and Permissions

## Agenda
- Announcements
    - you did CCW2! and CCW3 is next Friday, Jan 25
    - we're having class on MLK Day
    - feedback review
- Code review
    - Hashtables: quick conceptual roundup
    - Hashtables: one specific implementation
- Lecture
    - Integration Testing 2: Electric Boogaloo
        - it's not just about integrating the internet! it's also about integrating the UI layer!
        - Espresso basics: what it's for
        - Espresso cookbook
            - yes you should still be using something like a cookbook for your testing
    - App Permissions
        - this is where crossing the boundary from consumer to developer really feels like a transition
        - how to request permissions
        - what it looks like when you fail to request permissions, in code
- Interview, led by Sooz!


## Feedback review

- Vinicio: great
- missing 5 minutes of systems: I was wondering if you noticed! Not today, but they will return.
- Labs are hard, including features that weren't in lecture.
    - showed up in 12/13 surveys!!
    - 3 people: "most helpful"
    - 3 people: "most challenging/least helpful"
    - 1 person: "helpful, but not as first week of a new platform", which makes sense to me! Will plan to scaffold lecture/lab for week 6 more directly in future iterations.
    - For now, let's take tomorrow to catch up on missing features (with some new stuff to build too).
    - Stopwatch feature in particular has people stressed out--let's move on from that feature.
    - Please keep reaching out with questions during lab! 15 minute rule still applies on things like "this blog post has led me astray and I can't figure out how to get back to my previously working code".
- Code review
    - Some (2) said "less helpful", which I suspect is about differing implementations?
    - Some (3) said "were really good/helpful this week"
    - either way they're here to stay
