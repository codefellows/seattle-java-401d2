# Week 9 Feedback Review

- People liked the "recursion 201" lecture
    - awesome! I also love that lecture!
    - might do it before midterm projects next time, given that people found it so helpful.
- Too many tasks in the final week
    - yep, I agree.
    - next time, I won't have the day of Room first in TaskMaster.
    - TaskMaster will probably be 2 weeks, and health tracker will be 2 weeks. More time with Firebase, only doing auth through Firebase on Android. Super excited for the time I have before my next class to change that out!
- Many people feeling down/defeated about whiteboarding
    - do not feel too down! the entire point of this is to practice!
    - we will keep interviewing this week!
    - you all rock! seriously! even you, reading this right now!
