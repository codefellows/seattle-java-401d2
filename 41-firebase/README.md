## Feedback Review
- Really appreciate the focus on whiteboarding last week
    - open question: should I start building that in earlier next time?
    - as people complete their interviews this week, could potentially do more. Let me know!
- Rewarding to finish up career coaching: awesome!
- Lots of people feel like they're struggling hard and learning a lot. You're not alone.
    - "It was a tough week and I learned what many of my weaknesses as a developer are."
    - "I had to constantly convince myself that I am smart because I had a lot of moments where I felt humbled and dumb."
    - "I've learned a lot and had some rather challenging but fun issues that have taught me a lot."
    - "I think I was trying to do more than what I was healthily capable of doing within a time frame."
- Wanting to learn more about cloud, and about how to do auth.
    - today is going to be a great day
