### XML Layouts
Navigate to `app/res/layout/activity_home.xml` and double-click to view.

This is where we can design our layouts for each Activity. We will discuss activities later.

Click on the text tab at the bottom of the screen to show the underlying XML.

Then, go into the `values` directory and inspect the following 2 xml files, where you'll find the primary files we will be working with besides layouts:
* `strings.xml` - Should contain all the user-facing Strings of your app.
* `colors.xml` - Should contain all the colors for your UI
